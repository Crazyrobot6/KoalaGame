I think a TBS would be really sick, like a fire emblem type TBS where you control multiple characters in a party and they have different stats. They can be more tanky, have more damage (physical or magic) and have different ranges or spaces they can move, or speed to prioritize who moves first. Also there would be terrain bonuses and multipliers for attacking the same unit with 2 or more of your own party.
and as you think of more details and a story, just comment it
me too
those games are awesome
and there are different terrains
and you gain bonuses from height, or from angle you attack
and characters can be physical or magic, and they can be melee or ranged
Post the idea
and they have basic stats, like how many spaces they can move, attack, def, special attack, special defense
ok
so that it doesn't disappear into this convo
i should really go back to chem though
ok
fail
i posted it as a status
lel
i deleted it though
toplel
That looks programmable
I like that idea rewbie
And it should be easy to make it 3D
yeah
like early Pokemon style graphics
k that should make up for my smartass comments
as in bird's eye at an agnle
yes defintely
and also the battle animations
when you attack
can be like the pokemon battles
but just the moves
you wont be selecting moves in that format
but the animation
yeah. Like when you attack the enemy just has like slashes appear on them or something
mhmm
should it be rpg style?
Do you have 7 or 8 tomorrow?
where you level them up as the story goes on
maybe
8 tomorrow
and you can buy items/weapons/armor
and equip them
or should it be purely strategy, and have preset stats that dont change
and levels just get harder
hmm
or missions more complicated
I think RPG sounds cool
maybe a little harder to program
yeah
you'd have to add a lot more
like stat changes for each character
but as long as it didn't have grinding aspects, that's be cool
mhm
we don't have to have lots of items
items would be easy to add
like rings/boots/mail/gauntlets
cuz that makes it more grindy
to get all of them
in coding, getting one type of something is hardest
For example, the leaf game took a couple hours to get just the one leaf flipper working
but i think just armor and weapon is good enough
oh lol
but the second game, tree punching one
funfun
took like 30-45 min
and it worked
would characters only have a basic attack?
then I just spent time making graphics and falling leaves and refining some of the score elements
or would there be moves that they learn
or would it be like league, where you level it up
and have 4 base moves
or poekmon where you can learn new ones
some would be used for utility
ooh good ideas
ikr
im a beast
write this down either now or after final
write it down and give it to me or type it up
Want to hang out some tomorrow to talk about this?
im giving it to you right now lol
ik
FINE ILL WRITE IT DOWN LATER
GWAD
yay
